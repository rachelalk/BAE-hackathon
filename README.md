# BAE-hackathon

This hackathon was part of the BAE recruitment process. In a group of 3 we were tasked with creating a UI for a sustainability app that could be used in thr business.

We were given just 4 hours to do this.

We began be ideating and quickly came up with an idea that we were all on board with, a credit score like system that allows a user to collect points based on their choices e.g. transport.

We decided that it would be a good idea to add an element of competition so we added teams and a leaderboard along with insights and tips about how to improve your score.

In just 3 hours we had created a prototype from wireframes using Figma and spent the last hour beginning to code the homepage for our app and preparing to present what we had done.

You can view our wireframes <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8svog9UcPCBOIN1klFMw2a/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1">here</a>.
